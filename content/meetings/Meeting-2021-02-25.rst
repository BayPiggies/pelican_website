February Online Meeting: Python-based Build Systems
===================================================
This month, we will focus on build systems implemented in Python. We have two talks:
a lightning talk on Snakemake and a full talk on SCons.

Lightning Talk: Snakemake
-------------------------
Speaker: Jeff Fischer

`Snakemake <https://snakemake.github.io>`_ is a Make-inspired framework for reproducible data analysis
from the bioinformatics community. It provides integrations with shell, Python, Jupyter notebooks,
and scientific computing infrastructure.

Main Talk: SCons, a Python-based Make replacement
-------------------------------------------------
Speaker: William Deegan

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
`SCons <https://scons.org>`_ is an open source build tool written in Python. Originally released in 2001. It’s actively maintained and widely used. It’s developed with a focus on correctness, flexibility, and speed.

It’s currently used by numerous large software and hardware companies for apps and embedded software and games.

Attendees will get a quick introduction to SCons,it’s build files SConstruct and SConscripts, and some of SCons core concepts. Armed with this information, you can do a basic software build, and have a good base of knowledge to progress to fairly complicated builds.
