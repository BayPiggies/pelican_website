Lightning Talk: Cookiecutter
----------------------------
Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>`_ is a flexible tool that can be used for project generation and customization.
It is somewhat similar to (in the Java world) Spring Boot. There are a couple caveats to using it. First, unlike Spring Boot there is no automatic framework and it doesn't do the kind of customization that pip requirements.txt already does.

What does it do? Instead, however, it can create custom apps and custom Git repository resident apps that use customized data such as - the name of applications and files, ports, custom endpoints, actually just about anything that someone needs to customize.

It uses a very simple json file to create pairs of substitute names and values. These names can be used to represent a directory, or a file or text within a file. Or a port. Or even part of a directory or file name which gives it a lot of customization power.

Speaker bio: Richard Katz
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am an engineering and business programmer, a software and data engineer with Spark, Pandas, Flask and Django. I have used more languages than I can list here. My best friend, a LISP programmer who helped develop SQL, told me it would be good for me to learn Python. I immediately loved Guido's tutorials and Raymond Hettinger's example called: "Eight Queens, Six Lines." I am a big advocate of Jupyter, I like thinking about Princeton in the 1940s. I do a lot of reading about Python books and I'm writing one.
