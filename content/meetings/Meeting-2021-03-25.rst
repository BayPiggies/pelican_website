Talk Description
----------------
Scikit-Learn is an easy to use Python library for machine learning. However, sometimes scikit-learn models can take a long time to train. There are quite a few approaches to solving this problem like:

* Changing your optimization function (solver)
* Using different hyperparameter optimization techniques (grid search, random search, early stopping, etc)
* Parallelize or distribute your training with joblib and Ray

Attendees will learn about each approach, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and how to speed up their scikit-learn workflow.
