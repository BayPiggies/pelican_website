:summary: Django and Security

Topic:
  Django and Security

Speaker:
  James Bennett


Abstract:
 This talk will be a historical tour of the Django project's approach to security. We'll cover how Django's security policies have evolved over its eleven-year history, the ways the framework has integrated security as a major goal, and what we can learn from looking at patterns in the security issues that have occurred in Django. 


Speaker Bio:
 James has been using Django almost since the day it was publicly released, and a member of the Django core team since 2007. He currently serves on the Django security team and technical board, and as a Director of the Django Software Foundation. At his day job, James works to reinvent health insurance as part of the engineering team at Clover Health in San Francisco.
