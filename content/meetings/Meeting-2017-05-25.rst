Data Science Night: The Bowtie Dashboard Framework
==================================================

Speaker:
  Jacques Kvam


Abstract
--------
Creating useful visualizations is an important skill for data scientists. They
allow us to gain new insights into our data. Dashboards are powerful tools for
creating complex and interactive visualizations. You can explore data in ways
static charts cannot. `Bowtie <https://github.com/jwkvam/bowtie>`_
is a Python library that makes it easy to create dashboards. This talk will
introduce Bowtie and focus on creating dashboards and interesting features. I
will also discuss deploying them, the tech stack, and future work and goals. 

Speaker Bio

startup. He worked at Sandia National Labs as a staff R&D engineer. He studied
signal processing and communications at UW-Madison.
