January Online Meeting: Serverless Computing with Wesley Chun and More!
=======================================================================
BayPiggies will be going on hiatus over the holidays and be back in force for 2021.

See you in 2021!

Lightning Talk: To Be Announced
-------------------------------
Speaker: Chris Brousseau

BayPiggies regular Chris Brousseau will be giving a lightning talk with a data science
theme.

Main Talk: Serverless Computing with Python & Google Cloud
----------------------------------------------------------
Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
"Serverless" is a term that means many different things. It is a relatively new field of cloud computing allowing developers to focus more on the solutions they're building and worry less about the infrastructure. Are there really no servers? What is the outlook of serverless technologies in industry today? In this session, we will introduce developers to cloud & the serverless computing industry then focus specifically on serverless compute services. There are various ways Python developers can leverage serverless, whether it's entire (web) apps, mobile backends, functions/FaaS, or containerized applications.

Attendees will learn how to run code on Google Cloud serverless platforms... code samples will be in Python (and some JavaScript), but other languages are supported. Whether you're a developer, technical consultant, software engineer, DevOps/IT staff, or a systems analyst, you'll learn how to run code on Google's cloud and be part of a cloud-ready workforce. Long-time Python App Engine developers will get an update on what's going on in App Engine-land and get modernization tips.
