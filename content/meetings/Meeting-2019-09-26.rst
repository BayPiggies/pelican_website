Pigs, Pythons and Goats: The Animal Guide to TDD
------------------------------------------------

There are often many buzzwords that are used incorrectly and abused. Often
people hear about Test Driven Development (TDD) and think this is just a term
that means "Testing your code." Although Testing your code is important, Test
Driven Development is a special paradigm that is often used in certain
companies.

After this talk, you may decide that full Test Driven Development (TDD) isnâ€™t
for you (or, it may be a turning point for you). Regardless, you should fully
understand the paradigms and what it is - as it will come up in discussions
some time in your career.

To make it accessible to everyone, we will start this talk with an introduction
to Unit Tests and testing frameworks (e.g, unittest, pytest, nose, etc.) We do
a few very basic live demonstrations of both succeeding and failing unit tests.

We quickly, however ramp up building a data structure (e.g., stack, queue,
tree, etc.) using a full Red, Green, Refactor TDD cycle (cycles within Test
Driven Development). This will be somewhat interactive and there will be a lot
of slides with Python code.
