Data Workspaces: Python-based Management of your (Data) Science Projects
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modern scientific workflows can be very complex, involving many data sources, software components, and partial results. At the same time, many scientific workflows are not automated and incur significant manual effort or depend on brittle, one-time, scripts. As a result, scientists and data professionals have issues with managing experiments, collaboration, and reproducibility.

`Data Workspaces <https://dataworkspaces.ai>`_ (DWS) is a Python-based open source framework for managing scientific data and automating experiment workflows. Data Workspaces maintains the state of a science project, including data sets, intermediate data, results, and software. It supports reproducibility through snapshotting and lineage tracking and collaboration through a push/pull model layered on top of the Git version control system.
