May Online Meeting: PyCon 2020 Watcing Party
============================================

PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing
the open-source Python programming language. And, it's also a lot of fun!
However, because of the COVID-19 situation this year, we were not able to
attend in person.

Many of the speakers at PyCon have recorded their talks and they have been
posted by the PyCon organizers online. PyCon posts the talk videos every year
-- without hours or days after the talks have been given. The talks this year
are posted in the same locations.

But, isn't it funny how we need a little push - an event with our peers -- to
see what is available?  The Bay Area Python Interest Group (BAyPIGgies) will be
hosting a PyCon 2020 watching party. We will, as a group,
`review all of the videos that are available <https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/#talks>`_ .

And, then we will vote on the videos that interests us most.  We will vote on
our favorite videos to watch and watch 2-3 of those videos together.  We may
also be able to have some break out sessions like PyCon Open Spaces (but this
is still being finalized).  Even though we are meeting online (as always), it
is important that we keep our 
`Code of Conduct in mind <https://baypiggies.net/pages/code_of_conduct.html>`_.
We need to be Open, Considerate and Respectful. This is especially true in our
Open Spaces.
