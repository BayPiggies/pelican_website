May Online Meeting: PyCon 2020 Watching Party
=============================================

PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing
the open-source Python programming language. And, it's also a lot of fun!
However, because of the COVID-19 situation this year, we were not able to
attend in person.

Let's not let that stop us. We're going to make our own hallway track.

Many of the speakers at PyCon have recorded their talks and they have been
posted by the PyCon organizers online.

One of our organizers, Glen, used to have a Post-Pycon-Watching Party where we
would vote on our favorite videos, break out the projector, watch the winners,
discuss, and have fun.

We're doing an online version of that this year.


How do you participate?

1. Briefly review these talks:
   https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/#talks

2. Be ready to vote on your favorites when we post the voting board. (You can
   vote as many times as you like).

3. Be sure you know and follow our code of conduct:

   We need to be Open, Considerate and Respectful.
   Please keep conversation on Python and PyCon related topics.
