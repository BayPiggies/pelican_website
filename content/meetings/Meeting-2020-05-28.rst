May Online Meeting: PyCon 2020 Watching Party
=============================================
PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing
the open-source Python programming language. And, it's also a lot of fun!
However, because of the COVID-19 situation this year, we were not able to
attend in person.

Many of the speakers at PyCon have recorded their talks and they have been
posted by the PyCon organizers online. PyCon posts the talk videos every year
days or (sometimes within hours) after the talks have been given. The talks
this year are posted in the same location:

https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/#talks

But, isn't it funny how we need a little push - an event with our peers -- to
see what is available?  The Bay Area Python Interest Group (BAyPIGgies) will be
hosting a PyCon 2020 watching party. We will, as a group,
`review all of the videos that are available <https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/#talks>`_ .

And, then we vote on our favorite videos to watch and watch 2-3 of those videos
together. We may also be able to have some break out sessions like PyCon Open
Spaces (but this is still being finalized). Even though we are meeting online,
as always it is important that we keep our Code of Conduct in mind:

We need to be Open, Considerate and Respectful.
