Main talk
=========

"Mock It Till You Make It: How to Verify Your External Mocks Without Ever Leaving Unittest" presented by Liz Acosta
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A controlled environment and consistent dependencies are crucial to writing good and - most importantly - relevant 
tests in Python. While the advent of APIs has made using external services so much more accessible, APIs can lead 
to flaky or deceptive tests, ultimately putting applications at risk. In this talk, you will learn how to use Python's 
Mock object to create more reliable stand-ins for APIs beyond your control â€¦ all within the unittest framework.
