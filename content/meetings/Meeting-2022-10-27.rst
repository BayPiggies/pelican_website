Python and Graph Databases
====================================================
This month, we will have a talk on graph databases and Python from Jason Koo. We will also have a lightning talk, topic TBD.

Main Talk: Evidence for Graph Databases
---------------------------------------
Join us as we traverse the use of crime walls in movies and TV shows - as a graph. Along the way we’ll discover why Graph Databases are becoming increasingly popular, what technologies are currently available, and how to get started with them.

**Speaker Bio: Jason Koo**

Video Editor turned Pythonista, Jason Koo is Neo4j’s resident Python Developer Advocate. He has gone from working behind-the-scenes in Hollywood to developing mobile apps for Silicon Valley companies. He now leverages his love of both worlds to advocate new developer technologies.
