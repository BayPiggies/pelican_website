Special Guest: Alex Martelli (+ lightning talk)
===============================================
For our March meeting, Alex will hold an extended Q&A. Ask him questions about Python, software engineering, Google Cloud, writing books, or anything else on your mind. We plan to gather about 50% of the questions in advance, so he has time to prepare for some of them. The rest of the questions will be asked by the live audience. If you have never seen a talk by Alex,
you owe it to yourself to come hear him - he is a very engaging and insightful speaker! If you *have* seen a talk by Alex, then you know what we mean...

Here is a form you can use to submit questions for Alex: https://goo.gl/forms/3dcXVdSNlYXleu8A2

To add to the excitement, there will also be a lightning talk from Jayson DeLancey: **Visualizing 10M+ 3D Points with Point Processing Toolkit**.
