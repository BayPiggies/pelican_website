Production Data Science for Healthcare in Python
================================================
Speaker:
  Melanie Goetz


Abstract
--------
Productionizing data science often involves a team of scientists prototyping a statistical model in a language like R followed by a team of engineers translating and rebuilding that model into a “production" language. However, with Python, it’s easy to have your Data Science team and your Engineering teams working together collaboratively in the same language. But how does a modular production data science pipeline in Python look? This talk will cover how the data science pipeline at Clover automatically turns messy health data into insights and decisions.
