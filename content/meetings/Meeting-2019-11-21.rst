Statistical analysis of complex networks using NetworkX with applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective data visualization is critical to communicating results, and as
developers we are always looking to save time and write more clear code. All
projects use static graphs, and we see growing interest in interactive
visualizations that help us find insights difficult to see in static graphics.
Data science projects often use the foundational library Matplotlib which is
awesome but very complicated and sometimes hard to understand. In this talk,
we'll touch on Matplotlib and use a more modern library - Bokeh - to create
static and interactive visualizations.
