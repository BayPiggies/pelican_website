DevOps Buzzwords Explained for a Python Audience
------------------------------------------------------
This talk was inspired by a 2007 talk given at BayPiggies by Charles Merriam on web framework buzzwords and also by community interviews I recently conducted when considering a book proposal. This talk for DevOps buzzwords has been customized for the BayPiggies audience!

The DevOps/SRE space is huge. So, the talk will be a high level overview of DevOps and SRE work that would be visible or pertinent to the Python community.

There will be several demos of each of these areas within DevOps: Code, Test, Build, Deploy, Release and Measure. For simplicity, Ansible will be used for most demos where it can be applicable. And in the other cases, tools such as CircleCI will be used.

**Speaker Bio: Glen Jarvis**

Glen Jarvis has been a Web Developer, Informix DBA and DevOps engineer and manger for over 15 years. He has worked in companies such as IBM, Pandora and SiriusXM as well as helping to build several startups in the Bay Area that are still running today.
