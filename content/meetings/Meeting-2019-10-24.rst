Statistical analysis of complex networks using NetworkX with applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Networks can be used to model many types of relations and processes in
physical, biological, social and information systems. Many practical problems
can be represented by networks, also called graphs.  This tutorial will first
go over the basic building blocks of graphs (nodes, edges, paths, etc) and
common methods to get data structures into NetworkX-compatible format.  Then,
we can solve common problems like shortest-path on a real graph, and less
common ones, like implementing PageRank on a directed network to get PageRank
of each node in the network.


**Speaker Bio**
Lisa is a Data Scientist at Lagrangian.io, a startup focused on the use of
Terraform modules for backend services optimization.  Previously, she was a
bioinformatician with Geisinger Health System working on large-scale genomics
applications related to human health outcomes.  She earned her MS in
Bioinformatics at SoongSil University in Korea where she worked on chemical
analysis methods for simulated chemical structure (QSAR/QSPR) in Python.
