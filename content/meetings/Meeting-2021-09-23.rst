Django forms as a data management and ETL tool for R&D
------------------------------------------------------
As even a relatively small R&D-oriented organization grows, the need to aggregate data from multiple experiments becomes key to generating new insights to advance that growth. However, the data from these experiments is often scattered across multiple spreadsheets with different formats, and the tracking of metadata necessary for aggregation can be very poor. Creating a simple web application using Django forms enables this process by both allowing users to track experimental conditions and other associated metadata and to validate measurements taken within those spreadsheets. Furthermore, such an application can generate standardized spreadsheets to unify data collection efforts. Using even a relatively simple set of forms can provide a basis for a minimal viable product to start the process of aggregation and bridge the gap between siloed experimental spreadsheets and a more useful and user-friendly data warehouse solution.
