Abstract
--------
Python, an easy-to-learn programming language that is also used for many
sophisticated applications, is a great starting point for bringing people into
tech careers. This gives us the opportunity to reach out to underrepresented
groups and build a vibrant community.


For our October meeting, we will have a number of short talks to celebrate the
diversity of the Python community. These will range from narratives of personal
experiences, to career advice, to technical topics. We have an exciting list of
speakers. We hope you will join us!

--------

* **Karen Dalton** - Strategies for Making People Feel Welcome in Tech
* **Paula Alves** - How to contribute to open source software as a Python beginner, and why you should do it
* **Marilenis Olivera Lee** - Victories and struggles of an Expat/Latina/Mom in Tech
* **Ronald Lopez** - Using Pandas to better serve San Jose-Evergreen Community College District's diverse constituents.
