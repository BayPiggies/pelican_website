Abstract
--------
As the first technical employee and CTO of Sqor Sports, Noah Gift discovers how social media influences the NBA and vice versa. As a result, Sqor Sports has been able to grow to millions of monthly active users by leveraging influencers that were found by machine learning algorithms.

Noah shares his research and lessons learned on how social media and
the NBA intersect and explains how Sqor Sports uses data science and machine learning to determine NBA team valuation and attendance as well as individual player performance. Youâ€™ll learn how to recreate this research, working with a set of shared Juypter notebooks, also available in colab format.

Topics include:

* What drives the valuation of teams (attendance, the local real estate market, etc.)?
* Does winning bring more fans to games?
* Does salary correlate with social media performance?
