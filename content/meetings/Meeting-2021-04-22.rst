Beginner's Guide to Data Formats: JSON, XML, and YAML
-----------------------------------------------------
Reviving the famous "newbie nugget" format, Glen will compare and contrast the most popular data formats used in Python applications, along with their associated Python APIs.

PyMC3 is a python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and probabilistic machine learning. In this session, we will go over the background of Bayesian statistics and introduction into using the PyMC3 package for such scenarios.

Moreover, we will discuss what is coming up in the probabilistic programming ecosystem.
