pygwidgets: Object-Oriented GUI Widgets for Pygame
--------------------------------------------------
The talk will start with a quick description of the `pygame <https://www.pygame.org/news>`_ environment, which is used for building graphical user interface based games and applications in Python. Unfortunately, pygame does not provide standard user interface widgets (e.g., buttons, text boxes, etc.). "pygwidgets" (pronounced "pig wijits") was written to fill this void. I will explain the use of these widgets from a programmers point of view (the API), and talk about the implementation as a good example of object-oriented programming techniques.

The code may be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/IrvKalb/pygwidgets and the documentation at https://pygwidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
