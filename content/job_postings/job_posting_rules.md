# Job Listings

BayPIGgies is focused on discussion of Python programming and arranging community events. We want to encourage the Python job market, so we offer these guidelines for job ads; it's a win-win situation for everyone:

*    You must subscribe to the BayPIGgies mailing list so that you can read discussion of your ad
*    Principals only, no recruiters. We prefer ads to come from technical people to make it easier to get questions answered
*    Each company may post one ad per month
*    Please make clear how Python will be used on the job
*    Please restrict the geographic region to the greater SF Bay Area and Silicon Valley, roughly south down to Monterey, north to Santa Rosa, and (north)east to Sacramento
*    We will remove listings after 1 month and/or if they do not follow the above guidelines.
*    You may hit a larger audience by also sending to the mailing list.

**We reserve the right to change these guidelines any time; please check back each time before you post. **
