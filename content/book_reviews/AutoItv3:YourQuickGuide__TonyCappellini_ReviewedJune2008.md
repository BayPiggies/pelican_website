Summary: For those of you who aren't familiar with AutoIt, it is a fabulous open-source framework for automating Windows applications. It is full-featured, easy to use, very popular and has a large, active community supporting it. O'Reilly published a Shortcut for AutoItV3 in 2007.

<p id="vj9n9" class="western">This Shortcut is 55
pages in length, and gets you up and running with AutoIt very fast.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>After a short intro and
history on this automation framework, the author cuts to the chase to
describe data types, variables and scoping. For many programmers,
this is the right place to start to get an overview of the language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One of AutoIt's strong
points is its ability to display simple to mildly-complex GUIs,
without the pain and frustration of Microsoft’s Foundation
Classes or the complexities and bulk of the .NET framework. The
shortcut jumps right into GUI development very early and rightly so.
Several simple examples are provided to get the user’s feet
wet, as is an explanation on which event handling mode to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Several tables are
provided which contain the names and descriptions of AutoIts include
and UDF (User Defined Function) libraries. The UDFs contain a wealth
of free functionality to the AutoIt user, and are contributed by the
AutoIt community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>More descriptions of
the language constructs follow as well as an intro to automation via
COM.</td>

<p id="vj9n26" class="western"><strong id="vj9n27">Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p id="vj9n28" class="western">This being the first
O’Reilly Shortcut I’ve read, I must say that I will look
for others like it when working with a new language, framework or
technology for the first time.</p>
<p id="vj9n29" class="western">It is more promising
than some tutorials I’ve read, and highly recommend it for
first-time AutoIt users. For a commuter, one can ease the drudgery of
an hour long train ride and come up to speed by the time they arrive
at work with an O’Reilly Shortcut.</p>
