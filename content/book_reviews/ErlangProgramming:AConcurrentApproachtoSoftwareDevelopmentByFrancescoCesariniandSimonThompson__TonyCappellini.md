Summary: My first involvement with Erlang was while I had this book as a guide. I had no significant experience with functional programming concepts or “real concurrency”. I had been disillusioned about concurrency by using Python (aka Python threads). 


<p><img class="image-left" src="../images/2009/Erlang.gif/image_preview" alt="Erlang Programming: A Concurrent Approach to Software Development" />This is the main reason I have 
decide to investigate Erlang.</p>
<p>The book starts of with an 
interesting history and overview of Erlang, an introduction to concurrency, 
system robustness in distributed computation. Also included are a comparison 
to C++, and of course the “Why should I use Erlang“ section.</p>
<p>“Erlang Programming” is 
well-organized and covers enough of the key topics for a beginner to 
get started using Erlang as well as some advanced topics.</p>
<p>The author takes you through 
sequential and concurrent programming using Erlang as well as pattern 
matching, message passing, processes, error handling, GUI’s and distributed 
processing. There is a lot of material here not to be glossed over by 
newcomers. Functional programming requires a different way of thinking 
about structuring your code, and that new paradigm won’t come quickly 
to most people.<br /></p>
<p>One of the more-memorable paragraphs 
which strongly advocates for Erlang’s implementation of concurrency 
is on Page 9….</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Erlang and 
Functional Programming</strong></p>
<p>“The recent success of Erlang 
is a success for functional programming, too, because it uses functional 
programming principles without making a big fuss about it: they are 
simply the right foundation on which to build a language with concurrency 
designed in from the start.</p>
<p>One of the prevalent myths 
in the community in the mid-1980s was that functional programming languages 
would be the only languages capable of working on the general-purpose 
parallel machines that were “just around the corner.” It didn’t 
turn out like that 20 years ago, but perhaps that’s exactly what we 
are seeing now in the way that Erlang is being used to provide massive 
concurrency in server farms, cloud computing, and on the multicore processors 
inside all our computers, from laptops on up.”</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book 
to you if you are looking at <em>learning</em> Erlang. It will guide you 
through most of what you need to know to get up and running.</p>
