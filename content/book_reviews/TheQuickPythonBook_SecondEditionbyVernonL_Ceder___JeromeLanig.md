Summary: Vernon Cedar, the author of The Quick Python Book, First Edition, has written a well rounded introduction and reference manual to the Python scripting language.  My previous experience with coding was writing C at Nortel in the 90's.  I hadn't done much coding since, but I always had the bug to get back into it.  My friend suggested that I read and review this book as my introduction to Python.

<p>This book works extremely well as an introduction to Python programming; however, as a reference manual, it falls somewhat short - but I will still use it for reference.<br /><br />In chapter 1, The Quick Python Book teaches the engineer or manager why they should or shouldn't choose Python as a coding language. Chapter 2 is all about how to load it onto your computer and setting up the environment in Linux, Apple OS, and Windows. Chapter 3 is an overview of the language and begins to display the power and ease of use of the language. Chapter 4 is an introduction to the basics of Python - it is worth reading. <br /><br />Chapters 5 - 8 discuss string manipulation - lists, tuples, sets, strings, dictionaries, and control flow (if, else, and elif statements. The string manipulation of this language is well thought out and fun to use - and, it's presented in an accessible manner. <br /><br />As a manager, you only need chapters 1 - 8. If you're an engineer or student, then you will need to read through your way to the final chapter. You will be introduced to file systems and directories, reading and writing files, exceptions and error handling, and everything you need for a thorough introduction.<br /><br />For me, the only place that this book falls short is as a reference manual. Specifically, I was exercising some code and trying to do some remainder math. 'Remainder' wasn't in the index so I looked up 'DIV.' I saw division and followed those suggestions to pp 38-41. I had to read all those pages to find anything on remainders. I found in section 4.6.1 that there was a divmod function which might have solved my problem. Rather than have this information in a table, it was presented in paragraph form. So, even though I had the right area, the specific information wasn't always easy to find. In this specific case, I was told to, "See the documentation for details." I wanted to see the answers in the book in table format like the one specified on page 44.<br /><br />Then I got over myself and decided to use the book as a jumping-off point. If it's not in the book, I'll search online documentation for the answers. It's worth reading, and I would recommend that you buy it if you are new to Python.<br /><br /></p>
