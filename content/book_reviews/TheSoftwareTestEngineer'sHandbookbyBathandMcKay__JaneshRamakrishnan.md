Summary: The Software Test Engineer's Handbook by Bath and McKay will serve as a decent ancillary guide for an ISTQB Advanced Level candidate.


<p><img class="image-left" src="../images/SoftwareTestEngHandbook.gif/image_preview" alt="Software Test Engineers Handbook" />While the authors use a Marathon application system to serve as an testing example throughout the book, it would have been helpful to elucidate the concepts through programming examples. The concept of failure is not adequately discussed. This book meets the minimum ISTQB syllabi requirements, but still falls short.</p>
