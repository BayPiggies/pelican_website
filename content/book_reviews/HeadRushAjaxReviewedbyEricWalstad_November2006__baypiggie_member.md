Summary: Head Rush Ajax is a great beginning course that covers a few fundamental JavaScript programming concepts.  A beginning web developer will benefit from its slow, repetitivestyle that mixes graphics, conversational text, handwritten notes and homework-like exercises.  Developers experienced with JavaScript or looking for a JavaScript or Document Object Model (DOM) reference book should consider a different book.

It took me a while to get used to the teaching style as it felt painfully slow and discontinuous at first. I played along, though, warming to it a bit, but ultimately feeling like I'd be better served by a less chaotic writing style, something more in the 'reference' side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>What I liked most was getting to play with JavaScript. I'm a server-side developer, mostly, so I enjoyed the book's coverage of client-side code: using JavaScript to make asynchronous requests, manipulate the look of the page with the DOM and work with the server's response data (XML or JASON). I was a little surprised to find that the term AJAX refers to a small subset of what client side developers have been doing with JavaScript for a long time.<br /><br />Head Rush Ajax has whetted my appetite for more fun with JavaScript. It was a bit slow for my taste; I'd like a JavaScript reference rather than a book with classroom-like exercises. The format will probably work well for some, though. The authors work hard to anticipate reader questions and use a variety of methods to help commit the answers to memory. Head Rush Ajax is a good fit for beginning programmers. It's a light intro to JavaScript, the DOM and server response data in XML and JSON format.</p>
