Summary: The Quick Python Book is a good and short introduction/overview of Python 3. The book covers a lot of ground, but because it is relatively slim (about 300 pages or so) it is no wonder that in many places the author instructs the reader to look for more information from online sources. Additionally some more challenging topics (like decorators)  are not explained in enough detail, which leaves the reader wondering if those part should have been left out of the book  completely (or explained better).

<p>The book is well written and approaches the subject in a well thought<br />
order. It starts from the language essentials (you can skip chapter 3,<br />
as all the topics in that chapter are explained in more detail later<br />
in the book), spends some time in explaining functions and classes,<br />
touches GUI programming (using Tkinter only), and also covers some<br />
more advanced topics like regular expressions and testing. There is<br />
also a short section explaining how to port an application from Python<br />
2 to Python 3.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately some typos and mistakes have crept in the book so it is<br />
advisable to check the corrections from the online Errata as some of<br />
the mistakes in the code samples might confuse a novice reader. Also I<br />
would have liked to see the author pointing out more clearly the<br />
difference between Python 2 and 3 when introducing new topics.<br />
<br />
If you need to get up to speed with Python 3 quickly, this is a good<br />
book for you. As Python 2 is still the only option on some platforms<br />
(for example on Google's App Engine and on some mobile platforms) and<br />
as some of the add-on libraries do not yet officially support Python<br />
3, some people might want to still grab a book covering earlier Python<br />
versions.</p>
