Summary: Toby Segaran has written an excellent book in Programming Collective Intelligence.  The books introduces the algorithms and thinking for developing cutting edge recommendation engines, searching tools, and data driven analysis.  The beauty of this book is how Toby makes the subject fun and playful.

<table class="plain"><tbody><tr><td>Segaran
chooses simple snippets of code to assemble into powerful tools.   The
code examples are short and readable, with any Python specific language
features fully explained.   By connecting to real data from sites such
as <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a>,
Akismet blogging, and Yahoo Maps, the reader is drawn into the power of
these simple techniques to find the hidden power of collective
intelligence. </td></tr><tr><td>Different facets of collective intelligence are surveyed:<br />
recommendation engines, clustering, searching, reputations, optimized
matching, decision trees, and many other classification methods.  The
signal to noise ratio is great!  The sheer volume of material covered
is staggering!  Each chapter contains explanations and code for several
approaches to tricky problems.  In each chapter, a reader is<br />
given useful and solid techniques and is left with an appetite to dig into the references and details.</td></tr><tr><td>I
would strongly recommend Programming Collective Intelligence, the one
with the Penguins on the cover.  It provides serious tools to serious
programmers from journeyman to guru.  It is the must-have book<br />
for Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 applications.</td></tr></tbody></table>
