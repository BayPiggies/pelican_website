Summary: This is a good book for anyone working with the Enterprise products of VMware :ESX, ESXi and vCenter Server. 


<div><img class="image-left" src="../images/2010/cookbook.gif/image_preview" alt="VMware Cookbook" />The authors walk us through 
the installation of each of the products in detail(they even include 
screenshots of the installation process) in the first chapter. In the 
second chapter, they cover different types of storage and how to use 
them in an ESX environment. In the third chapter, they cover recipes for
 configuring networking for ESX. In the fourth chapter, they cover the 
important topic of resource management.</div>

<div>What I really liked about the book is that in the 
fifth chapter, they present a bunch of really useful command-line tools.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I
 wish they covered at least a part of the different APIs (for example: 
vSphere PowerCLI) that are provided by VMware but may be they plan to 
cover these in a future edition of the book.</div>
