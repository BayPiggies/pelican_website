Summary: This book is for people who have a Mac and are willing to invest in a text editor called TextMate.


<p><img class="image-left" src="../images/2010/textmate.gif/image_preview" alt="TextMate: Power Editing for the Mac" />This is a must read book for people who want to use TextMate. Theauthor begins with the very basics of TextMate and chapter by chapterhe builds up on the different features of TextMate.<br />
Once you get used to the power/convenience of using TextMate, it ishard not to use it. For example, here are some of the commands that Ifound useful:</p>
<ul><li>Apple-key + R (builds and runs the code in the current active window.)</li><li>ctrl + shift + N (shows the number of lines, words and bytes in thecurrent document.)</li><li>ctrl + shift + C (math mode, pretty useful for performing quick and 
dirty math)</li><li>todo + tab (gives a commented section in which the list of things tobe done can be listed)</li><li>Apple + / (for commenting/uncommenting code)</li><li>head + tab (gives a commented header section to write the descriptionof the code).</li></ul>
<p>
As mentioned before, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is<br />
considering using TextMate.</p>
